# Banking Simulation
## A project I did in college, it's a simulation to calculate the banking interest of a loan.
#### 2021, IUT de VÃ©lizy, 78 - France

Coded mostly in PHP, in a group of 6, in wich I was the project director and lead developer.

The website also saves the history of banking simulation done and an admin interface to save or delete this history
